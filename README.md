This is a website for drivers to check condition on the road. It aims to be a all-in-one platform for drivers to get the necessary information to make the decision on their travels(e.g. Avoid what lanes? Bring jacket? ). It also allows saving of users data: place of stay, reminders to display information such as the weather forecast and today's To-Do so it can further aid their decision making.

### Design Process
*UX* : 
As a driver, I would want a platform where I can see my plans for the day and see the traffic condition without having to switch screens. This ensures that I will not miss any important events (meetings, dinner with family,etc) and be able to plan my timing way ahead based on the traffic condition and weather.

This app is also customised for each individuals as they will be greeted on the landing page of the website with the time(morning, afternoon/evening/night), and also the weather at the place they have inputted during the sign up. More of the weather forecast is on the seperate weather page. User can click on the link in the navigation bar.

Considering there are also very few apps that offer traffic information, it's also important for the website to be as informative and give as much needed and necessary data as possible. Yet, considering there might be overwhelming amount of data, the search function (for carpark and incident) is also there to filter out the information for convinience. 

*UI* : 
I decided to go for a more simple colour scheme and font as it's a website that must cater to all individual's taste. I added colours at the header and footer on all pages for consistency. I've also decided to go with the typical landing page, footer and header of websites. All of these is to ensure that the website looks professional.

### Testing

*Mobile vs Desktop view*

The difference for mobile version is that all rows that have multiple columns will be brought down, so there will only be one column in mobile view. 

*Bugs/Possible problems*

1. Weather forecast in the main page(below greetings) and in weather page will return data of 31/12/2020 when real time data of API gives empty field
2. Logging out will clear the data of reminders 
3. Clearing cache will clear the data of sign up
4. Map of traffic images might not return any data. If it doesn't, an error message will be shown. 
5. Traffic incident page might return error 429:Too many data requests. Hence, alert will be shown.
6. Carpark API might return error 500: Internal server error. Hence, alert will be shown.

*Manual user Testing*
